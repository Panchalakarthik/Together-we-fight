<i>Earth, 1980</i>

2
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,453
Come!
- Slow down.

3
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,100
* My favorite person!
Come!

4
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:35,665
* Where are you gonna take me?

5
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:36,539
Mari.

6
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:38,736
Look.

7
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:40,914
Awesome!

8
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,390
I was afraid he could
not land here.

9
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,093
But it is rooted quickly.

10
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,718
And soon spread to
various places.

11
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,499
On the whole universe.

12
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,199
I do not know what
you're talking...

13
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,327
...but I like the
way you say it.

14
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,067
My heart belongs to you...

15
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:00,602
Meredith Quill.

16
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,452
I do not believe it, I fell
in love with an astronaut.

17
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,217
<i>34 years later</i>

18
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,860
<i>Sovereign</i>

19
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:59,241
It's time!

20
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,325
* Will arrive anytime anywhere.

21
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:03,704
He's a loser.

22
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:06,546
I thought you would
prefer to use a sword.

23
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:08,028
We are hired to stop the
inter-dimensional beings...

24
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,781
...of eating the battery, and
I want to stop by the sword?

25
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,301
Sword and gun is the
tool you are my tools.

26
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:15,964
But we both use guns now.
I'm just not aware of.

27
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,261
Drax, why do not you wear
because aero Rocket?

28
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,265
It's painful.

29
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,963
Painful?

30
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,684
I have sensitive nipples.

31
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,349
<i>Putting me sick!
Whoops!</i>

32
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,345
What about him?
What's he doing?

33
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,211
I set up so we could listen
to when running a mission.

34
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:35,366
Why is that important?

35
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,603
Blame Quill.
He is so loved by the music.

36
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,647
No, I agree with Drax.

37
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,592
* Important not directly present.

38
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:43,637
Okay.
Yes it is, Quill.

39
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:46,477
Seriously, I agree with Drax.

40
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,955
No, I understand.
You look quite serious now.

41
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:52,607
I can clearly see you wink.

42
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,767
Whoops.
I use my left eye?

43
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,240
I Groot.

44
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,589
They are not looking
at you strangely.

45
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:10,863
It was very intense.

46
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,005
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy 2</i>

47
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,156
Groot!

48
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:31,386
Groot, to the edge!
You could get hurt!

49
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,787
Good!

50
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,672
Do not!
Saliva back!

51
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:18,888
Fast!

52
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,032
Disgusting!

53
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,886
The skin of this creature is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

54
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,251
I have to cut it from the inside.

55
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,677
Huh?

56
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,738
Do not!
Wait a minute, Drax!

57
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:34,867
Drax!

58
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:45,634
What did he do?

59
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:49,025
He said, his skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he...

60
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:51,223
That would be absurd!
- I'm trying to tell him!

61
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,803
The thickness of the skin is the
same from inside or outside!

62
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:54,974
I already know.

63
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:00,304
There was a wound on his neck.

64
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,294
Rocket, made him glance up.

65
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,541
Hey, sea monkeys!
On this!

66
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,509
Be careful, Quill!

67
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,079
Yes!
I am alone...

68
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,581
...kill these creatures!

69
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,210
What?

70
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,575
It is called what?

71
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:26,957
Battery Anulax.

72
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,122
Battery Harbulary.

73
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,756
It was not the same
as what I said.

74
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:34,609
But it is worth a
thousand units a piece.

75
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,442
Sovereign's why we
hired to protect him.

76
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:39,285
Be careful what you say.
They are easily offended.

77
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,322
Means violating the death penalty.

78
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:47,036
We thank Guards as
willing to sacrifice.

79
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:51,432
Sovereign people's lives can not
afford to take that risk. *

80
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:55,674
Every citizen who is born is
created by the community.

81
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,337
Perfect, both physically
and mentally.

82
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:02,270
We control the DNA of our offspring...

83
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,092
...they sprout in the pod birth.

84
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,624
I think I prefer my
men the old way.

85
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,975
Maybe you can give me
a history class...

86
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,928
...ways of our ancestors.

87
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:17,586
For academic purposes.

88
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,515
I will feel proud.
Yes.

89
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:20,939
On behalf of the study...

90
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,529
I think it's a bit...

91
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,814
...disgusting.

92
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,155
I do not like casual relationship so...

93
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:29,224
Please...

94
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,611
People you have something
new to our service.

95
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:33,573
Bring...

96
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,140
...and we will
go with pleasure.

97
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,095
Family meeting.

98
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:54,730
I understand that
she is your sister.

99
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,610
He's more valuable to me than
the hunting him in Xandar.

100
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:03,050
Our troops arrested him when he
was trying to find batteries.

101
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,735
Make what you like of him.

102
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,849
Thank you, Pastor Top Ayesha.

103
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,628
What breeds you, Mr. Quill?

104
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:19,612
My mother was from Earth.

105
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:21,406
And your father?

106
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,946
He is not from Missouri.
That's all I know.

107
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,617
I seemed to be in you.

108
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,338
Genealogy outstanding.

109
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:36,243
It looks like a hybrid...

110
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:38,715
...careless.

111
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:43,503
I heard them say, you people
are very arrogant and rude.

112
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,195
But that is not true immediately.

113
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,375
I use one eye again.
Right?

114
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,970
Sorry, it should be behind you.

115
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,783
You should feel lucky
they did not kill you.

116
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:01,510
You just tell me.

117
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:03,012
You want to buy a battery?

118
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,520
All right, let's bring this to Xandar
bald man and demanded his reward.

119
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:29,080
<i>Great set of 2</i>

120
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,786
The thing was about my dad.

121
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:15,814
He remembered who he was?

122
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,240
I know you are very
sensitive to it.

123
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,064
I'm not sensitive to it.
I just do not know him.

124
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:25,485
Sorry, if I look like a spree
with the Supreme Priest.

125
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:27,294
No.

126
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:28,973
I do not mind at all.

127
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,040
I think you care.

128
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,117
That's why I'm sorry.
Sorry!

129
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,423
Gamora not for you, Quill.

130
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:38,595
You are like a shadow.

131
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,468
In this universe there are
two kinds of existence.

132
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,207
Those who dance and
those who do not dance.

133
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,014
Mmm.

134
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,949
I found the love of
my life in war rally.

135
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,180
Whoops.

136
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,230
Everyone in the village
danced with crazy.

137
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,533
Unless a woman.

138
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:54,445
I Ovette.

139
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:57,524
I knew immediately he
was the one for me.

140
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,325
Even the world's best
melodic songs played.

141
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,408
He will not knock his feet.

142
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,705
It will not move a muscle.

143
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,312
Others may think he's dead.

144
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:10,472
There is a sense of immediate interest.

145
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,713
It would make me swell genitals.

146
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:15,251
Okay I understand.

147
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,773
I'm a dancer, Gamora not.

148
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:21,515
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic, just like you.

149
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,723
I'm hungry.
Give me a bit of the root Yaro.

150
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:31,706
Not.
It is not yet ripe yet...

151
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,872
...and I hate you.

152
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:34,276
You hate me?

153
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:36,402
You left me to steal
the stone itself.

154
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,966
But you still standing
here, a hero.

155
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:42,101
I will be free of handcuffs
later and I'll kill you.

156
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,877
I swear.

157
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:44,944
Not.

158
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,004
You will live forever
in prison Xandar.

159
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,366
Hope you can.

160
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:57,946
This is weird.

161
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,075
We have a group of ship
Sovereign follow from behind.

162
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,028
Why did they do that?

163
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,526
Perhaps the reason Rocket
stole their batteries.

164
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:03,733
What is this!

165
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,448
All right.

166
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:06,854
He did not steal it.

167
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,696
Somehow they were chasing us.
Mystery properly.

168
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,194
What do you think?

169
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,191
It was easy to be stolen!

170
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,371
That's your excuse?
- Do not!

171
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,820
You saw the Supreme
Priest underestimate us.

172
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,927
I just want revenge!

173
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,105
I am not sure this is
your motivation altruism.

174
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,223
Unfortunately, the real intention of
Sovereign misunderstanding you...

175
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,365
...and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

176
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,412
I'm just being sarcastic!

177
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:39,253
Whoops!

178
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,704
You should use a sarcastic tone!
Now I look silly!

179
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:43,652
Can we stop fighting...

180
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,912
...so that we survived
the war in this space?

181
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,415
The more ships!
- Good!

182
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,205
I want to kill people!

183
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,627
You did not kill anyone.

184
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:00,404
The ship was escorted away.

185
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,727
Useless!

186
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,893
Why postpone, Admiral?

187
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,700
Top clergy, the happy
battery to explode.

188
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,283
It can destroy the entire fleet.

189
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,809
The issue we are insulting
them against our people.

190
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:29,264
We hired them and
they stole from us.

191
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,836
It was the worst mistake.

192
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,724
<i>The control module...</i>

193
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,883
<i>...shooting with intent to kill.</i>

194
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:50,173
Planet inhabited
what is closest?

195
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:52,496
It's called Berhert.

196
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,145
How leap?
- Just one.

197
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,875
But the center is a
47-click access.

198
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,876
And you have to traverse
the asteroid field.

199
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:11,294
Quill, to cross...

200
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,130
...you got to be the
best pilot in space.

201
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,424
Luckily we both, I...

202
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:15,591
I am that man.

203
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:29,635
What are you doing?

204
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,751
I've been flying airplanes
for the past 10 years.

205
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,725
I specially modified to be
a pilot of a spaceship.

206
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,184
You specially modified
to be a fucking!

207
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,620
Stop.

208
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,630
Tonight, you will lie
down on the bed...

209
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,083
...and there will be flaccid
thing in your pillowcase.

210
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:44,518
And you wonder, <i>What is this?</i>

211
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,692
And it will be so because
I put shit in it.

212
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:50,495
You put shit in my bed,
I shaved your hair.

213
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:51,900
It's not bullshit me.

214
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:53,542
It belonged to Drax.

215
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,205
I am famous for a
large tailings.

216
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,554
We are about to die, and
this is what we talk about?

217
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:05,710
Seriously!

218
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:07,540
Hey, let me...

219
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,168
Stupid!

220
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,289
*

221
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,704
* Sovereign behind us.

222
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:33,917
*

223
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,577
*

224
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,128
Hold out.

225
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:52,343
*

226
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,435
<i>Spacesuit for anxiety
or excitement</i>

227
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,989
Quick, Zylak.
You can do.

228
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:07,844
Yes!

229
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,361
* To leap location.

230
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,110
*

231
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:15,154
Proceed!

232
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:31,330
*

233
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,315
Death, spaceship!

234
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:42,470
You have got to, Zylak.

235
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:43,695
Aye.

236
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,425
5 click!

237
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:54,805
Whoops.

238
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:56,914
They surround this field!

239
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,028
Some people get rid
of all of our ships!

240
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:14,929
What?

241
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:18,891
Who?

242
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:21,785
One click!

243
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,702
What's that?
- Who cares?

244
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:26,892
It was a leap!
Go!

245
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:31,279
He was a man.

246
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:40,194
Whoops.

247
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:41,527
He's still out there?

248
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:10,265
Groot, wear a belt!

249
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,811
Preparing for severe landing!

250
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:47,869
<i>Berhert</i>

251
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,199
It was amazing!

252
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:58,998
Yes!

253
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,418
Watch it!

254
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:04,866
Where half of our ships?

255
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:05,716
My ship.

256
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,747
One of you two can get
us out of this field...

257
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,865
...if you terbangkannya with the
brain not with your genitals!

258
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,393
* If in between my legs
had nothing to do...

259
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,489
...I'm sure I can
land this ship.

260
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,470
Peter.

261
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,387
We almost died because
of your pride.

262
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,156
No, because he stole...

263
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:24,509
...Anulax battery.

264
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,644
It's called Harbulary battery.

265
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,601
One, not that!

266
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,448
You know why I stole
the Star-Munch?

267
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,663
I will not be responsible
if <i>Star-Munch</i>.

268
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,567
I stole because I want to!

269
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:37,525
Why do we talk about this?

270
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:40,632
We were rescued by a man
who removed the 50 ships!

271
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:41,484
How small?

272
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:43,295
I do not know, like this?

273
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,544
One inch man save us?

274
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:47,958
If he's closer, I'm
sure he's bigger.

275
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,109
That's how our eyes work,
has raccoon fools.

276
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:51,518
Do not call me a raccoon!

277
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,979
Forgive me.
I've been in.

278
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:56,947
I mean panda waste.

279
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:00,280
It is better?

280
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:02,382
I do not know.

281
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,769
It is more severe, very severe.

282
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:06,191
You are...

283
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:06,871
Hey!

284
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,169
I can not take it with you!
- Do not! Go!

285
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:10,652
Some people follow you
through the leap.

286
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:14,708
Let me go.
You need my help.

287
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:16,333
I'm not stupid, Nebula.

288
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,256
You foolish to refuse
to assist in the match.

289
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,590
You will attack when it is released.

290
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:20,728
I will not do so.

291
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,885
You think the thugs will
learn how to lie well.

292
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:25,836
I'm sure it's a human
one inch of it.

293
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,356
After a long time,
finally to see you.

294
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:03,918
And who are you?

295
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:07,960
I remember, my face was so
handsome enough to explain.

296
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:11,572
My name is Ego...

297
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,870
...and I'm the father, Peter.

298
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:23,378
<i>Contraxia</i>

299
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:32,651
You know what they say...

300
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,028
<i>You're out of luck
until you get it back.</i>

301
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,116
Yondu!

302
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:05,834
Download here!

303
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,470
After years with no results...

304
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,474
...I ended up marrying this woman.

305
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:25,247
I said, <i>Aleta, I love you...</i>

306
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,959
<i>...but you've lost your mind!</i>

307
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:28,990
What's more, he did so.

308
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,317
I can not trust him.

309
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:31,910
Stake.

310
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:37,647
It's been a long time.

311
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:45,894
Apparently, the place is
somewhat less suggestive.

312
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:53,664
Stake.

313
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,866
There are 100 groups Ravager, Sneeper.

314
00:25:56,147 --> 00:25:58,868
You lost 99 trade you because
you are dealing with.

315
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,667
Please, sir.
Help!

316
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:01,978
Stay away from me.

317
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:08,739
You go die!

318
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:12,850
I do not care what
you think about me!

319
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,538
So, why did you come with us?

320
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,406
For you will hear what I said!

321
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,965
I do not need to hear anything!
You break the rules!

322
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,437
Ravager got a raw
deal with the boy!

323
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:24,102
I told you!
I do not know what's going on!

324
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,012
You do not know because you do not want
to know, because it makes you rich.

325
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:31,593
I insisted on a place at the table.
I use this fire, like you.

326
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,168
You may dress like us...

327
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:35,883
...but you will not hear Hon
freedom when you die, Yondu.

328
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:37,908
And Varna Orgord...

329
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:41,316
...will not be hoisted on your grave.

330
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:43,997
If you recall...

331
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,897
I like to throw you...

332
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,774
...you are wrong.

333
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:55,611
You disappoint us all.

334
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:12,665
Pathetic.

335
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,899
First, Quill betrays us...

336
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:18,663
...and Yondu let him alone.

337
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:21,551
We follow him...

338
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:25,292
...because he's not afraid to
make what should have been made.

339
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:27,803
Apparently, he was gentle.

340
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:31,326
If he had been lenient
why are you whispering?

341
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:33,741
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

342
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,490
You better be careful when
talking about our captain.

343
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:39,877
Who is that?

344
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,551
Yondu Udonta.

345
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,210
I have a suggestion for you.

346
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:27,568
I hired Yondu to take you...

347
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,176
...after your mother died.

348
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:31,088
But, on the return you...

349
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:32,916
...Yondu take care of you.

350
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:35,566
I do not know why.

351
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,344
I'll tell you why.

352
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,960
My skinny boy who can squeeze
into places adults *

353
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,397
It is easier to steal *

354
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:46,154
Since then I began to
keep track of you. *

355
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:48,832
I remember Yondu is your father.

356
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:51,329
What?
We've been together.

357
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:53,297
You remember Yondu my real dad?

358
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:55,721
You two look alike.

359
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,091
He's blue!

360
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:00,808
No, he's not my father!

361
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,943
Yondu is the person
who kidnapped me.

362
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,273
At the worst, so I
learned to fight.

363
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:07,439
Fun scare me by
threatening to eat me.

364
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:08,764
Eat you?
- Yes.

365
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:10,684
It was a mess!

366
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:12,846
How did you track us?

367
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:16,770
In the place I live in, on the
outskirts of the mystery...

368
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,030
...we hear about people
called Star-Lord.

369
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:20,962
Why do not we go there now?

370
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:24,046
Your friend invited.
Including monkey-faced triangles.

371
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,250
I promise to you...

372
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:29,029
...it's not like a
place you've ever seen.

373
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:31,031
And there...

374
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:35,275
I can tell you a
special history.

375
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:37,699
Finally can be...

376
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:39,532
...the father of my dreams.

377
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:43,450
Forgive me.

378
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:45,709
I have to go pee.

379
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,017
I do not believe.

380
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:57,063
Let's take a break.

381
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:05,547
I Mantis.

382
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:10,879
What are you doing?

383
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:12,498
Smile.

384
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:16,352
I heard, it acts to
make others like you.

385
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:18,674
No, if you are creating.

386
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:23,134
I grew up alone on
the planet Ego.

387
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,441
I do not understand the
complexities of social interaction.

388
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:33,217
May I touch your dog?
It's very cute.

389
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:38,239
Can.

390
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:50,511
This is called playing with people!

391
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:55,636
I like!

392
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,544
I made an excuse!

393
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,199
Please help!

394
00:31:03,506 --> 00:31:05,614
After all this time, you
show up and suddenly...

395
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,205
...you want to be my father?
- I understand.

396
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:08,764
And also, this may be a trap.

397
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:11,147
Kree real, Ravager...

398
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:12,834
...they want to kill us.
- One idea, but...

399
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,425
But, what?

400
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:17,033
What story did you tell
me about Zard Hasselfrau?

401
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:17,993
Who?

402
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,756
He has a miracle boat.

403
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:22,520
David Hasselhoff?

404
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:23,727
Really.

405
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,829
Not a miracle boat.
A car talk.

406
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,290
Why did he speak?

407
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:30,248
To help him fight the criminals,
and become supporters.

408
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,438
Childhood, you take a picture
of him in your pocket...

409
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,271
and you will tell all
the other children...

410
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:37,782
...he is your father,
but he is out of town.

411
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:40,444
Recording <i>Knight Rider</i>
or create a group show in Germany.

412
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,907
I tell when drunk.
Why do you say that now?

413
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,046
I love that story.

414
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:45,708
I hate that story.

415
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,361
It's so sad!

416
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:52,239
Childhood, I always saw other
kids playing with their father.

417
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,537
And I just wanted so, over
all things in the world.

418
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:57,679
That's what I mean, Peter.

419
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,717
What if this person
is you Hasselhoff?

420
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,230
If he actually mean...

421
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,404
...we kill him any time.

422
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,280
You left me with the weasel?

423
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,928
He's not a fox.

424
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,806
Shoot him if he was suspicious.

425
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,214
Or like hearts.

426
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,175
Just a couple of days.

427
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,992
We will be back here before the
Rockets finished repairing the ship.

428
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,423
What if Sovereign come?

429
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:39,940
Odds are they know where we are.
Let's go.

430
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:42,152
I worry if we split up.

431
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:43,786
Oh, you're like an old man.

432
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:44,968
Because I'm smart?

433
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,188
Why do you have so many bags?

434
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,322
I do not want Groot
play my stuff.

435
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,893
I hope your father is not
as bad as you, the orphans.

436
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:02,663
What is your goal?
Make everyone hate you?

437
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:04,181
Because it is successful.

438
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,207
Can I ask you a
personal question?

439
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:59,000
Nobody ever asked me
a personal question.

440
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,860
Antena you, it's what?

441
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:02,721
Usefulness?

442
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,471
Yes, I have a bet and Quill.

443
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:07,099
You should not mention about it.

444
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:08,801
I said...

445
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,686
and at the door if
you're too low...

446
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:14,450
...the antenna you will feel it and
prevent you from a decapitated head.

447
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,840
Really.
And if it other than...

448
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,213
...you beheaded by
a low door, I win.

449
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:23,003
It is not to feel the
height of the door.

450
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:25,808
I feel...

451
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,271
...it has to do with
my telepathic ability.

452
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:30,149
What's that?

453
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,312
If I touch someone, I can
feel their feelings.

454
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,267
You read the thoughts of others?
- Not.

455
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:38,794
People can know the mind telepathy.

456
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,405
Feelings of empathy.

457
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:44,124
Emotions.

458
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,166
Can I touch it?

459
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:49,957
Can.

460
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,842
You love.

461
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:05,863
I think I have feelings
of love for everyone.

462
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:07,133
Not.

463
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,745
Romantic, sexual love.

464
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:10,821
Do not have.

465
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,990
For him!
- Not.

466
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:13,382
It was not.

467
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:16,162
Okay.

468
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:22,179
He had to tell everyone
you hidden secrets.

469
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:24,471
Hey, I think you're already in.

470
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,309
You should be ashamed!

471
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:30,589
Touch me!

472
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:41,028
I've never felt like
this feeling amused.

473
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:44,830
It's not fair.

474
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:48,163
Quill.

475
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,375
If you touch me, you
will feel a broken jaw.

476
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:04,013
I can also change a
person's feelings.

477
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:05,527
Like what?

478
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:07,753
If I touch people sad...

479
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,300
...I can warm his
heart for a moment.

480
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:15,094
I can make a good person bad.

481
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,719
But I used to use it to
help my master bedroom.

482
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:23,191
He always lie at night
thinking about her.

483
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:26,507
Try to do to me.

484
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:31,877
Sleep.

485
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:26,956
I love this song.

486
00:37:59,195 --> 00:37:59,993
There!

487
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,980
Not so strong again
without your game.

488
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,233
Right?

489
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,061
Move!

490
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,792
Whoops.

491
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,659
Hey, rats!

492
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:54,845
Hello there, blue
people are stupid?

493
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:56,968
Not bad.

494
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,565
Apparently, we have a
very good point here.

495
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,715
The golden girl high
opinion of himself...

496
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:07,954
has offered a lot of money for
you and your friends drag him...

497
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,344
...because he wants
to kill you all.

498
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,886
Your Friend...

499
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,363
They are too many.

500
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,925
He needs my help.
If you're worried about him...

501
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:19,732
...you have to let
me out of this bind.

502
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:21,803
They will kill him!

503
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:24,861
Actually, I was
happy to find you.

504
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,566
I put the sensors
on your boat...

505
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,014
...during the war with Xandar.

506
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,734
Promise me you will
not hurt Groot...

507
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:33,062
...and I'll tell you
where the battery was.

508
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:36,222
You good luck, my
words do not count.

509
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,116
If not, I have to drag you.

510
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:41,348
If so, what are you gonna do?

511
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:43,433
We will take the battery.

512
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:46,669
It's worth what?
Quarter of a million on the open market.

513
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,169
Highest Priest was
offering us a million.

514
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:52,210
Quarter only 1/3 of it!

515
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:54,318
Not third quarter.

516
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,776
Quarter is 25.

517
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:56,807
Not.

518
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:59,630
We can not buy a pair
of shoes with 25 units.

519
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,533
Enough!

520
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,842
Whatever, we're not so stupid to help
kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

521
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,907
The entire Nova Corps will hunt us.

522
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,928
That is not true!

523
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,852
My son spoke this time, captain.

524
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:16,636
No matter how many times
Quill betray you...

525
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,587
...you protect him like
we all got very important.

526
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:22,534
I support you!

527
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:23,920
Calm, Kraglin.

528
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:26,022
That's right, man.
He was lenient.

529
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:29,160
It feels, it's time
to change the head.

530
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:36,060
Put down your weapons!

531
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:38,515
Whoa!

532
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:41,115
There must be a good
solution for this situation.

533
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:44,282
Or a violent way in which
I was standing there.

534
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:05,544
Hey, all.

535
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:12,389
It is not yet ripe!

536
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:40,189
<i>Planet Ego</i>

537
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,433
Welcome, all, to my world.

538
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:03,900
You have your own planet?

539
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:07,061
Come on.
Lebuh similar to the Earth.

540
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,041
Very humble.

541
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:10,409
I like.

542
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,344
I was also very touched.

543
00:43:56,169 --> 00:43:59,797
You have a planet and can destroy
the spacecraft without spacesuits.

544
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:01,944
What are you actually?

545
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,853
I called the Celestial.

546
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:10,407
Celestial, like God?

547
00:44:12,955 --> 00:44:14,042
<i>T</i> a little.

548
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,869
At least, there are days I
feel like Drax generous.

549
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,585
I am not sure where I came from.

550
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:37,712
The first thing I remember *

551
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:40,265
*

552
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:43,626
*

553
00:44:44,763 --> 00:44:46,409
More than millions of years...

554
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:49,937
...I learned to control
molecules around me.

555
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:53,561
I became more clever and strong.

556
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:58,755
And I continue to
build from there.

557
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,242
Layer upon layer...

558
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,181
planet are you running now...

559
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:04,938
Whoa...

560
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:07,064
But I want more.

561
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,031
I want...

562
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:11,146
...meaning.

563
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:15,800
There must be a life out
there in the universe...

564
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:18,931
<i>...other than myself </i>, perhaps.

565
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:22,761
So, I decided to look it up.

566
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:25,624
I create...

567
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:28,230
biological life as I imagine...

568
00:45:28,922 --> 00:45:32,687
...up to the smallest detail.

569
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:35,351
You have created a penis?

570
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:36,456
Hey!

571
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:38,242
What's the problem with you?

572
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,313
If he is a planet, how did he
get the kid with your mother?

573
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:43,773
He will destroy your mother!

574
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:46,683
I do not need to hear
how my parents...

575
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,202
Why?

576
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:53,781
My father's story of how he made my
mother pregnant, each winter solstice.

577
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:54,982
It was indecent.

578
00:45:55,728 --> 00:45:56,252
It is very beautiful.

579
00:45:58,317 --> 00:45:59,910
You Earth people have emotional problems.

580
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,247
Yes, Drax.
I have a penis.

581
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:04,090
Thank you.

582
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:06,229
It's not as bad as you think.

583
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:10,185
I also have a sense of pain
and digestive system...

584
00:46:11,106 --> 00:46:12,867
...and all the things there.

585
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:17,532
I want to feel what it
feels to be a human being.

586
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:20,148
As I explore in the stars...

587
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:23,716
until I found...

588
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:25,501
...what I want.

589
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:28,379
Life.

590
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:33,019
I am not alone in this universe.

591
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:40,542
When you met my mother?

592
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,430
Shortly afterwards.

593
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:57,223
With Meredith, the first
time I feel love.

594
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,747
I call him my lily river.

595
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:10,718
And for the love of it, Peter...

596
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:15,807
You.

597
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:25,875
I've been looking for you.

598
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:30,919
And when I heard about
a man on the Earth...

599
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:33,146
who hold the stone in his hand
Infiniti without dying...

600
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:38,080
...I know you must be the
son of the woman I love.

601
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,914
If you love her, why
did you leave him?

602
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:05,860
This rebellion!

603
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:08,224
This rebellion!

604
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:10,244
This rebellion!

605
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:24,649
You bastard!

606
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:01,390
Captain!

607
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:03,045
Help me!
Please help!

608
00:49:04,249 --> 00:49:04,879
Captain!

609
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,563
It is you who kill people...

610
00:49:11,378 --> 00:49:12,869
...to lead them
down the wrong path.

611
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:15,063
For you weak.

612
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:19,001
And stupid!

613
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:23,738
It's time to Ravenger...

614
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:27,767
to come back to the glory
days of the new captain...

615
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:31,043
Taserface!

616
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:40,472
Sorry.
Your name is...

617
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:42,674
Is Taserface?

618
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,313
Really.

619
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,821
Are you shoot a
taser on your face?

620
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,914
It's a metaphor!

621
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:51,349
Yes!

622
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:55,602
For what?

623
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:01,252
Because it's a scary name...

624
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,242
...on those who hear it.

625
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:07,066
Okay.

626
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,462
Okay...

627
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:10,769
What you said...

628
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:12,261
You shut up.

629
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:13,628
You next.

630
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:18,708
Udonta, I've been
waiting to do...

631
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:19,549
What?

632
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,569
Forgive me.

633
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,301
I kept imagining
when you wake up...

634
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:29,777
look in the mirror intently
and said to myself...

635
00:50:30,064 --> 00:50:34,326
<i>You know what the name of a
very scary person? Taserface!</i>

636
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:38,125
That's what I hear
you in my brain.

637
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,915
What is the name of the second one are you?

638
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:42,906
Schrotus Hat?

639
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,150
The new plan.
We'll kill you first.

640
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:52,088
Better dead than
live a lifetime...

641
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:57,070
...as a useless person who remembers
the name Taserface is fashionable.

642
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,973
Enough for today's murder.

643
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,620
He is the son of Thanos.

644
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:10,783
I thought you were the worst
torturers in the universe.

645
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:12,577
That's when my father was
still paying my bills.

646
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,537
Top clergy wanted to
kill the fox itself.

647
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,137
And his head is a reward in
about 12 provinces Kree.

648
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:23,006
I guarantee...

649
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:26,214
It is not easy to wear me like a
parent without a magic wand...

650
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,075
...or wild forest speak.

651
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:31,379
I want to reward the 10% of...

652
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:34,885
...and some other things.

653
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:38,184
We have a lot of hand...

654
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,241
...if that does not work.
- It's fine.

655
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:43,945
You remember Kree captain
would kill them?

656
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:47,099
People let their singer Kree *
but he got sick.

657
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,733
This is it.
Boat best that we have.

658
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:53,729
Cities Ego planet
in the system *

659
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:56,028
We'll send you 10%
after we *

660
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:57,869
What would you do
with the money?

661
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,894
Ketch time, my father always told me
and Gamora fighting during training.

662
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:06,084
Whenever my sister won...

663
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:08,982
...my father will be replaced
with something on my machine.

664
00:52:10,398 --> 00:52:12,734
He said he wanted me
to be comparable.

665
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,485
But he won...

666
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:20,867
many times and never avoid *

667
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:23,983
So, after I kill my sister...

668
00:52:24,986 --> 00:52:28,241
...I'm going to buy a warship with
every weapon that carries death.

669
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:31,708
I would rush to my father like a
dog and I'll tear him slowly...

670
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,304
one by one...

671
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:37,285
until he felt a bit of pain
agonizing endlessly...

672
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:39,933
...as I feel each day.

673
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:43,089
Yes.

674
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:45,904
I am talking about
a beautiful chain.

675
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:47,629
Or a pretty hat.

676
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,416
Something that makes the
girl said, <i>It's beautiful.</i>

677
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,795
Anyway, congratulations
to explore.

678
00:53:06,701 --> 00:53:08,915
My mother told my father
of all the stars.

679
00:53:11,932 --> 00:53:14,191
He was suffering from brain cancer.
So, everyone thought he was delusional.

680
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:15,120
Peter...

681
00:53:15,452 --> 00:53:17,454
I really want to believe
it all, really.

682
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:18,900
But you leave...

683
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:21,357
The best woman...

684
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:23,377
...to die alone.

685
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:26,632
I do not mean to leave
your mother, Peter.

686
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:29,399
If I rarely go back
to my planet...

687
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:31,043
and light in it...

688
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:32,752
...This form will wither and disappear.

689
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,729
Why do not you go back?
Why are you sending Yondu?

690
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:36,880
A robber, who came
to take me away.

691
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:38,996
I love you, Peter!

692
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:41,602
I'm not willing to
go down to Earth...

693
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,923
...see she's gone!
You can not imagine the feeling!

694
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,753
I know how you feel it!

695
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,830
I had to see him die!

696
00:53:53,955 --> 00:53:57,808
In my life that
millions of years...

697
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:00,076
...I made a lot of mistakes, Peter.

698
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,009
But you're not one of them.

699
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:08,564
Please give me a chance to
be the father he wants.

700
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:18,295
There are many things I have to
teach you about on this planet...

701
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:20,542
...and the light in it.

702
00:54:21,536 --> 00:54:23,775
It's a part of you, Peter.

703
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:26,396
What do you mean?

704
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,324
Give me your hand, my son.

705
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,597
Here.

706
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:34,346
Hold this.

707
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:43,335
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

708
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,194
Bring your brain to the
heart of the planet.

709
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,066
Yes!

710
00:54:54,418 --> 00:54:56,123
Wow!

711
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:57,390
Yes!
It's fine.

712
00:54:58,022 --> 00:54:59,505
Calm down.
Pay attention.

713
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:00,639
You can do.
Try again.

714
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:02,979
Yes!

715
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:07,047
Yes, now bentukkannya.

716
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:08,744
Feel that energy.

717
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,496
So.

718
00:55:19,122 --> 00:55:19,866
You're back.

719
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:23,561
Peter.

720
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:01,401
How do you get to the
planet's stupid and weird?

721
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,261
Ego see me when I was
in the form of larvae.

722
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,464
Orphans in my world.

723
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,359
He exaggerated my own and
be a companion at his side.

724
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:12,863
So, you are a pet.

725
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,059
Presumably.

726
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,909
Usually, people
want cute animals.

727
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:21,250
Why the ego wants an ugly beast?

728
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:22,908
I'm ugly?

729
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:25,291
You can scare people
when they see fit.

730
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:29,788
But it was good also.

731
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:32,761
When you're ugly and
nobody loves you...

732
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:34,406
...you know they
love you sincerely.

733
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,944
Beautiful people do not
know who to believe.

734
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,244
If so, I am very
proud to be ugly.

735
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:47,797
The pool reminded
me of a time...

736
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,197
...when I take my son to the
lake is forgotten in my world.

737
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:53,913
He's just like you.

738
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:55,366
Disgusting?

739
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:57,710
Innocent.

740
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,474
Drax?

741
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,463
There's something I
need to tell you.

742
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:45,177
Why is this?

743
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:47,021
The lady beetle
is my new friend.

744
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:50,347
I learned a lot of things,
like my pets and ugly.

745
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:52,207
You got ugly.
Drax!

746
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:53,955
What are you talking about?

747
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:55,042
Mantis.

748
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:57,194
Can you show us where you live?

749
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:00,387
Why no other creature
on the planet?

750
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,109
This planet is Ego.

751
00:58:02,966 --> 00:58:05,138
A dog will not pick lice
to live on her body.

752
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:06,717
And ye are not lice?

753
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:08,416
I tick that no purpose.

754
00:58:10,376 --> 00:58:11,313
I help him sleep.

755
00:58:12,085 --> 00:58:15,313
What do you want to tell
Drax before I came in?

756
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:22,137
Do not have.

757
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:24,496
Where you live here.

758
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,579
We will send you into
Kree tomorrow morning.

759
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:40,848
You two can not hold
much longer after this.

760
00:58:42,497 --> 00:58:43,272
Okay, Taserface.

761
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:46,610
Tell the others, we say...

762
00:58:46,943 --> 00:58:47,973
<i>Hi, Taserface!</i>

763
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:56,438
How about this little tree?
I can crushed with stones?

764
00:58:56,802 --> 00:58:57,373
Do not, Gef.

765
00:58:58,236 --> 00:58:59,340
He's too cute to kill.

766
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,999
Take him to a tailor.

767
00:59:03,703 --> 00:59:06,189
Do not get me wrong, but
you're so useless employees.

768
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:13,207
I'm a slave for 20 years
until my release Stake.

769
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:18,149
He gave me a place in Ravager.

770
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,404
He said, I just have
to follow any rules.

771
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,593
But I was young...

772
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:29,247
...greedy and stupid.

773
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:33,011
As you steal the battery.

774
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:34,345
It all Drax.

775
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:38,976
I, stake and the other captain...

776
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:42,850
We have no difference as
you and your friends.

777
00:59:44,454 --> 00:59:45,567
The only family I have.

778
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:48,693
When I broke that rule...

779
00:59:51,565 --> 00:59:52,518
...they threw me.

780
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,530
Indeed, I should receive.

781
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:57,498
Quiet, drama queen.

782
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,524
You probably deserve
it, but I do not.

783
00:59:59,816 --> 01:00:00,539
We should get out of here.

784
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:03,664
Where Quill?

785
01:00:05,223 --> 01:00:06,104
He came out with his father.

786
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,770
Ego?
- Yes.

787
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:11,029
Today is full of stupid name.

788
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:17,089
For a moment, I feel good.

789
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:19,390
But it was spoiled
by the ugly teeth.

790
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:22,024
As a professional, or what?

791
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:23,388
*

792
01:00:23,612 --> 01:00:25,642
Why do not you send Quill
to Ego as promised?

793
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,681
He was emaciated.

794
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:32,264
To insert a place that we can not afford.
Good to steal.

795
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:40,141
I know how to get out of here.

796
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:44,277
We need the help of
your little friends.

797
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:52,338
Mascot!

798
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:01,354
The little boy was angry!
He needed a drink!

799
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,415
Look how cute he is
when he's angry.

800
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:11,873
He's very cute.

801
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:28,120
Hey, stick!

802
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:29,527
Come here.

803
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:30,978
Mari.

804
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:39,233
What is this.

805
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:40,859
What did they do to him?

806
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:45,604
Hey, you want to
help us out of here?

807
01:01:47,281 --> 01:01:49,779
I want you to take
something for me.

808
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,592
In the captain's room, there
is one flipper prototype.

809
01:01:55,196 --> 01:01:56,942
The thing that I
have in the head.

810
01:01:57,283 --> 01:02:00,878
There is a drawer by the bed.
It's in there. Red.

811
01:02:01,453 --> 01:02:02,138
You understand?

812
01:02:36,267 --> 01:02:37,500
It was in my pants.

813
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:39,717
I'm sure she does not
understand what you say.

814
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:41,734
You need to explain
more clearly.

815
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:46,923
It flipper prototype.

816
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:55,283
It orloni.
It had fins, Groot.

817
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:57,211
Let me tell you this time.

818
01:02:58,612 --> 01:02:59,200
All right.

819
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:02,091
It points Vorker.

820
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,644
He was out while he slept.

821
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:06,011
Go, look again.

822
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:07,625
But it points to stay here.

823
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,180
Why?

824
01:03:09,513 --> 01:03:10,675
She'll wake up tomorrow...

825
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:12,518
and he would not know...

826
01:03:12,937 --> 01:03:14,796
...where his eyes!

827
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:22,963
That table.

828
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,368
We say, it is this.

829
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:34,505
Tell me, do you have
a fridge in here...

830
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:36,368
...a few stubbed toes.

831
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:40,327
Okay, we agree we will not
talk about this anymore.

832
01:03:44,673 --> 01:03:47,887
Drawers that you have to go
there this symbol on it.

833
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:49,368
Okay?

834
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,443
What? Not!

835
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:01,410
He remembered, you tell
him to wear it as a hat.

836
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:02,652
That's not what I said!

837
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:05,049
I Groot!
- He was relieved because you do not ask her to wear.

838
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:06,453
I Groot.
- In hate hats.

839
01:04:06,696 --> 01:04:07,514
I Groot.

840
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,956
In all people, not himself.

841
01:04:09,206 --> 01:04:09,999
I Groot.

842
01:04:10,234 --> 01:04:11,925
Instant seem strange rattle...

843
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,112
...after that you noticed
some new head is a hat.

844
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:15,969
That's why you do not like the hat?

845
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,213
It was an important
discussion today?

846
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,629
Not that.

847
01:05:07,284 --> 01:05:08,783
I do not mean to be disloyal.

848
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:13,034
They killed all my friends.

849
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,718
Set to be released
third quadrant.

850
01:05:27,276 --> 01:05:27,984
One more.

851
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,866
Do you have any copies of
music Quill on this ship?

852
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:23,854
He's been taken!

853
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:25,293
Yondu fins take it!

854
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,285
Go!

855
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:09,195
Down there!

856
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:09,056
You're crazy.

857
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,294
The whole ship will explode.

858
01:09:23,303 --> 01:09:24,343
Not all of them.

859
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:42,659
Who is this?

860
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,123
I'll send the coordinates
to ship Yondu.

861
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:49,410
Remove the quadrant!
- Good, Captain!

862
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:51,994
I only have one request.

863
01:09:52,713 --> 01:09:54,397
Priests Meet Top ye...

864
01:09:54,728 --> 01:09:58,072
...tell him the names of
people who will put her fate.

865
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,874
Taserface!

866
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:25,347
Where, captain?

867
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:26,334
Ego.

868
01:10:28,718 --> 01:10:29,109
Do not!

869
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:42,040
Not bad for the body of mammals
jump more than 50 times at a time.

870
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:43,162
I know.

871
01:10:43,517 --> 01:10:45,145
We will make a 700!

872
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:01,601
So, I think all this might
belong to me later.

873
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,206
Rocket, you hear?

874
01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:13,806
What are you doing, Peter?

875
01:11:16,914 --> 01:11:17,834
Dance with me.

876
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,801
I'm not going to dance with you.

877
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,242
The Sam Cooke...

878
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,307
...one of the best
singers on Earth.

879
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:56,579
Drax guess you're not a dancer.

880
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,218
If you tell anyone about this...

881
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,563
...I'll kill you.

882
01:12:02,558 --> 01:12:05,643
If we are going to do something
that can not be called among us?

883
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,413
What is it that can not be called?

884
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,049
That is...

885
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,781
<i>Cheer </i>, Sam and Diane...

886
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:17,339
a man and woman in the
TV show who love...

887
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:19,978
...but not admitted because if
admitted, the audience will be reduced.

888
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:21,229
Something like that.

889
01:12:21,469 --> 01:12:22,712
There are no objects that
can not be mentioned.

890
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:27,910
So, this is a dilemma, because if you
call, it will continue to call...

891
01:12:28,161 --> 01:12:29,180
...and you'll be a liar.

892
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:30,480
So, with no call...

893
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:34,430
...you're speaking the truth
and agree with something.

894
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,711
No, that's not what I...

895
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:43,185
What we should discuss
now is about this place.

896
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:45,084
Feels like something wrong.

897
01:12:46,185 --> 01:12:47,157
What are you talking about?

898
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:49,847
You told me to come here.

899
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,302
The woman, Mantis...

900
01:12:51,553 --> 01:12:52,323
...he was afraid of something.

901
01:12:52,837 --> 01:12:54,220
You want to take it from me?

902
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,864
Not.

903
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,215
He's my father.
He was my ancestor.

904
01:12:58,434 --> 01:12:59,950
You have descended on Earth and
you do not want to go back there.

905
01:13:00,138 --> 01:13:01,419
Again, you told me to come.

906
01:13:01,765 --> 01:13:03,909
And the Earth is where my
mother died in front of me.

907
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:07,405
Not because the place where it
exists and is here like a shadow.

908
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,877
This place exists!
I'm half human, remember?

909
01:13:10,222 --> 01:13:11,474
Half that's what I worry about.

910
01:13:11,745 --> 01:13:13,477
I understand.
You jealous...

911
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:16,628
...because I'm half god and
you love it when I am weak.

912
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:18,849
From the start you're so arrogant.

913
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:20,673
I can not get a Rocket!

914
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,182
I'm going out to
get a clear line.

915
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,530
You know what?
This is not <i>Cheer </i>!

916
01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:28,048
This is the case where
people are willing to...

917
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:31,584
receive new possibilities,
and the other was a bully...

918
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:33,273
...who do not believe in anyone!

919
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:34,994
Things that would not exist! *

920
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:36,896
Therefore it will be 0 ratings.

921
01:13:37,757 --> 01:13:39,715
I do not know, what it <i>Cheer </i>?

922
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,507
Eventually I found my family.
You understand me?

923
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:45,628
I thought you had
forgotten the family.

924
01:14:49,453 --> 01:14:50,484
Crazy person!

925
01:17:00,723 --> 01:17:01,881
Let me correct you!

926
01:17:29,614 --> 01:17:30,491
I win.

927
01:17:30,824 --> 01:17:32,417
I won the tournament.

928
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:34,600
Not.
I save your life.

929
01:17:35,004 --> 01:17:36,559
You are a fool let me live.

930
01:17:37,034 --> 01:17:38,090
You let me live!

931
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:39,806
I do not need you to beat me!

932
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:42,922
I do not fly across the
universe just to win.

933
01:17:43,173 --> 01:17:44,583
Do not tell me what I wanted.

934
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,099
I do not ever tell
me what you want!

935
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,010
That's obvious!

936
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:49,547
You just want to win.
And I just want a sister!

937
01:17:58,443 --> 01:17:59,443
You're all I have.

938
01:18:01,448 --> 01:18:02,711
But you have to want to win.

939
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:06,555
Thanos pull my eyes
out of your head...

940
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:09,352
and my brain out of the skull...

941
01:18:11,293 --> 01:18:12,474
and my hands on the body...

942
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:15,800
...as a result of you.

943
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:29,720
<i>Great set of 2</i>

944
01:18:38,123 --> 01:18:38,943
You got any?

945
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:44,851
I saw your girlfriend
rushed out earlier.

946
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:46,213
Yes.

947
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:48,625
Sure enough...

948
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:50,220
...You hear this song as well.

949
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,789
You know...
- Brandy?

950
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,406
By the Looking Glass?

951
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,541
Your mother's favorite song.

952
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:58,531
That is correct.

953
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,338
One of the best musical
composition on Earth.

954
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:03,042
Perhaps the best of the best.

955
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:04,056
Yes!

956
01:19:04,402 --> 01:19:07,966
Peter, we like a
gob in the song.

957
01:19:15,845 --> 01:19:19,367
As a child my mother
embodied in...

958
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,600
...or the freedom
you give the Gamora.

959
01:19:37,001 --> 01:19:38,664
Ocean recall his browser.

960
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:41,400
He love the girl, but
it was not his place.

961
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:46,160
Ocean summon him as a great
man in history to call on.

962
01:19:47,356 --> 01:19:50,556
And sometimes we are denied
the pleasure of men.

963
01:19:51,485 --> 01:19:53,731
You may not be a man, but I do.

964
01:19:54,048 --> 01:19:54,788
No, Peter.

965
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:56,881
Death is like a
stranger in our...

966
01:19:57,466 --> 01:19:59,416
...while the light was still
burning in the planet.

967
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:01,549
I'm immortal?

968
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:04,726
Really?

969
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,465
Yes!
As long as this light still exists.

970
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:12,058
And I can use light to
create an amazing thing...

971
01:20:12,401 --> 01:20:13,988
...like how do you build this planet?

972
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,471
It may need a few million
years of training...

973
01:20:16,885 --> 01:20:18,283
...before you become proficient.

974
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:19,405
But, yes!

975
01:20:19,616 --> 01:20:20,147
What?

976
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:24,682
It's like building a 800-foot
statue of Pac-Man and Skeletor...

977
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:25,654
...and Heather Locklear.

978
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:26,823
You can do anything you want.

979
01:20:27,124 --> 01:20:28,253
I will do something quite strange.

980
01:20:28,597 --> 01:20:30,892
You know, Peter.
It's a big responsibility.

981
01:20:31,552 --> 01:20:33,852
Only we can recreate
this natural...

982
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:37,324
Only we can stop the universe...

983
01:20:37,785 --> 01:20:39,257
...and move it to
where you should go.

984
01:20:40,973 --> 01:20:41,665
How?

985
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:53,692
Follow me.

986
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,832
Drax.

987
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:07,606
Drax!
I have something to say.

988
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:11,039
Sorry.

989
01:21:12,045 --> 01:21:13,641
But I like a woman with
a more moderate body.

990
01:21:14,032 --> 01:21:14,566
What?

991
01:21:14,856 --> 01:21:18,617
I'm trying to push you to
tell that you're so ugly.

992
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,101
Not.
It was not my intention.

993
01:21:23,976 --> 01:21:24,535
What are you doing?

994
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:28,377
I would like to imagine
us together physically.

995
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:29,231
Drax.

996
01:21:29,499 --> 01:21:31,144
I do not like you so.

997
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,575
I also did not like
that kind of like you.

998
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:35,828
Hey!
Needless to result.

999
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,938
Listen!
Ego can have what he wants.

1000
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:40,624
I should have told you sooner.

1001
01:21:40,999 --> 01:21:43,692
I was stupid.
You're in danger.

1002
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:51,022
What's that?

1003
01:21:54,427 --> 01:21:58,551
Now, you have to adjust yourself
to the way you understand life.

1004
01:21:58,862 --> 01:22:01,490
All objects around us,
including the girl...

1005
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:04,434
Everything is temporary.

1006
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,200
It is we who remain timeless.

1007
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,691
Did not live forever
would be bored?

1008
01:22:09,969 --> 01:22:11,209
Unless you have a goal, Peter.

1009
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:13,632
That's why you're here.

1010
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,666
I've told you so many before.

1011
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:20,933
I have never ceased
to push to find life.

1012
01:22:21,352 --> 01:22:24,875
But I got to tell you
how I finally found it.

1013
01:22:26,037 --> 01:22:27,769
Everything is...

1014
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:30,898
...disappointing.

1015
01:22:31,983 --> 01:22:34,165
From there I received...

1016
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:39,048
...deep awareness.

1017
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:44,424
My natural desire to
find another life...

1018
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:49,385
...but not to live with them.

1019
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:52,570
Peter.

1020
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:57,590
I have found the meaning.

1021
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:17,561
I see.

1022
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,754
Immortality!

1023
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:24,237
No.

1024
01:23:35,018 --> 01:23:36,298
We need to get out of this planet.

1025
01:23:51,013 --> 01:23:51,856
Ouch.

1026
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,930
Before I interrupted savagely...

1027
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,005
At that time, I was
a Federal Express.

1028
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,226
What are you doing, boy?

1029
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:12,463
I heard you talk about him...

1030
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:14,031
...that the Ego is bad news.

1031
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:15,784
We are here to save Quill.

1032
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:20,381
For what?
To honor? To love?

1033
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:22,223
Not.
I do not care about that feeling.

1034
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,249
I want to save Quill
to prove me better!

1035
01:24:25,747 --> 01:24:28,455
I can be better than him.

1036
01:24:30,793 --> 01:24:31,817
You laugh at me for what?

1037
01:24:32,223 --> 01:24:36,980
You can trick yourself and
others, but you can not fool me.

1038
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,169
I know who you really are.

1039
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:41,250
You do not know anything
about me, weak.

1040
01:24:41,898 --> 01:24:43,401
I know everything about you.

1041
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:46,785
I know you behave
brutal and gritty...

1042
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,679
...but actually you
are most afraid of.

1043
01:24:49,004 --> 01:24:49,639
Shut up!

1044
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:51,582
I know you stole a battery
that you do not need...

1045
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,151
and you force people who are
willing to tolerate you...

1046
01:24:54,561 --> 01:24:55,760
Because little love...

1047
01:24:56,213 --> 01:25:00,026
...remind you of just how big and
empty your hearts to the truth.

1048
01:25:00,256 --> 01:25:00,939
I said, shut up!

1049
01:25:01,245 --> 01:25:04,334
I know a scientist who you love but
do not care about you directly.

1050
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:05,514
I'm serious!

1051
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:08,514
As my parents sold me...

1052
01:25:09,061 --> 01:25:11,200
...children of their own, to make slaves.

1053
01:25:11,759 --> 01:25:13,517
I know you are, boy.

1054
01:25:14,105 --> 01:25:15,295
For you are like me.

1055
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:24,341
What kind of partner we have?

1056
01:25:26,283 --> 01:25:28,449
Type that would go against
a planet, I think.

1057
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,301
All right!

1058
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:32,376
Instant.

1059
01:25:32,688 --> 01:25:33,492
Fighting what?

1060
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,197
Who are you really?

1061
01:25:39,656 --> 01:25:40,312
What is this place?

1062
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,321
Gamora, let her go!

1063
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:43,732
The body of the
cave, who are they?

1064
01:25:45,026 --> 01:25:45,883
You're afraid.

1065
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:52,435
I call it, the extension.

1066
01:25:54,163 --> 01:25:55,761
It is my goal.

1067
01:25:56,177 --> 01:26:00,736
Now, it is your goal as well.

1068
01:26:02,163 --> 01:26:03,246
It's beautiful.

1069
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:06,160
For thousands of years...

1070
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,233
I planted a huge extension of me...

1071
01:26:10,092 --> 01:26:12,151
...in the thousands worldwide.

1072
01:26:13,217 --> 01:26:16,927
I have to fulfill the main
goal of a real life...

1073
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,028
To grow and spread...

1074
01:26:19,364 --> 01:26:21,957
includes everything that exists...

1075
01:26:22,472 --> 01:26:26,863
so everything is...

1076
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:28,415
...me.

1077
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:30,781
What did he do to me?

1078
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,553
He has told me everything.

1079
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:35,794
I only have one problem.

1080
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:41,366
A Space Creature does not have
sufficient authority for this program.

1081
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:44,849
But two Space Creatures...

1082
01:26:45,181 --> 01:26:48,722
...may be able to achieve now.

1083
01:26:51,084 --> 01:26:52,047
The body was...

1084
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,081
...is his son.

1085
01:26:55,899 --> 01:26:57,381
Of all my work...

1086
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,416
most require trick is...

1087
01:26:59,735 --> 01:27:02,145
...I attempted grafting
of DNA with other species.

1088
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:05,975
I hope that the relationship
should be pretty random...

1089
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:07,743
...for the extension of my altered.

1090
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,475
I told Yondu send people to me.

1091
01:27:11,752 --> 01:27:16,224
It's against the rules, but I
Ravager pay compensation to many...

1092
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:18,880
...and to comfort her, I
said, I will not hurt them.

1093
01:27:19,272 --> 01:27:21,652
I mean, it was right.
They will not feel anything.

1094
01:27:21,963 --> 01:27:24,069
But all disappoint me.

1095
01:27:25,295 --> 01:27:28,530
No person who has a
gene Creatures Space.

1096
01:27:29,435 --> 01:27:30,332
But you have, Peter.

1097
01:27:31,925 --> 01:27:33,761
Of all my seed...

1098
01:27:34,502 --> 01:27:37,939
...only you who is no
relation to the light.

1099
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:41,936
We need to find Peter now
and get out of this planet.

1100
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:43,816
Ego must be affecting him now.

1101
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:46,329
Then, we go.
- Not!

1102
01:27:46,904 --> 01:27:48,928
He's our friend.
- You all just...

1103
01:27:49,165 --> 01:27:50,275
...screaming to each other.

1104
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:51,668
You're not his friend.

1105
01:27:51,977 --> 01:27:52,726
That's right.

1106
01:27:53,983 --> 01:27:54,854
We are one family.

1107
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:58,012
We will not leave anyone.

1108
01:28:01,812 --> 01:28:02,631
Maybe except you.

1109
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:04,815
Ouch.

1110
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:07,476
For the first time in my life...

1111
01:28:08,207 --> 01:28:10,213
...I'm not alone!

1112
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:17,637
Why?

1113
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:21,923
My friend.

1114
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,137
Listen.
It's human nature for you, Peter.

1115
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,589
Yes.

1116
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:32,118
We are more of everything.

1117
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,149
Yes.

1118
01:28:35,988 --> 01:28:37,024
Now...
- But my mother...

1119
01:28:40,038 --> 01:28:42,053
You say you love her.

1120
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,558
That's right.

1121
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:49,808
Lotus river I know all the lyrics
to every song played on the radio.

1122
01:28:51,936 --> 01:28:54,040
I went back to Earth to
see him in three times.

1123
01:28:54,803 --> 01:28:57,104
And I knew if I went
back the 4th time...

1124
01:28:57,628 --> 01:28:58,601
...I will not go.

1125
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,461
Extension of this...

1126
01:29:03,312 --> 01:29:05,399
...is the main reason for my
existence will be exhausted.

1127
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:07,576
So, I did what I should do.

1128
01:29:08,074 --> 01:29:13,545
But rather reluctantly me to put
it on the head of her tumor.

1129
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,009
What?

1130
01:29:20,213 --> 01:29:21,075
I know...

1131
01:29:21,453 --> 01:29:22,733
...it sounds less fun.

1132
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:37,828
We remember, who are you?

1133
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:40,088
You killed my mother!

1134
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:41,428
I have tried...

1135
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:42,804
all efforts...

1136
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:44,740
to find a form of...

1137
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:46,597
the most suitable for you...

1138
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:49,791
...and this is how you thank?

1139
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:52,949
You have minded adults.

1140
01:29:58,308 --> 01:29:59,433
I wanna do it together...

1141
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:04,993
*... that you're supposed
to be used as a battery.

1142
01:30:07,913 --> 01:30:09,215
Finally!
Rocket.

1143
01:30:09,736 --> 01:30:12,144
Place the transmitter near
it with so I can find you. *

1144
01:30:12,422 --> 01:30:15,618
We were in the old building
Yondu tool used...

1145
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:17,176
...to divide two A'askavaria Bank.

1146
01:30:17,492 --> 01:30:18,253
Ego was crazy.

1147
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:19,480
I know.
Ready.

1148
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:20,813
Cut him loose, Kraglin.

1149
01:30:39,937 --> 01:30:40,702
No.

1150
01:30:59,547 --> 01:31:00,281
Peter.

1151
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:03,344
This is the ocean.

1152
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:47,990
*

1153
01:31:58,884 --> 01:32:00,380
What happened?

1154
01:32:07,978 --> 01:32:09,503
Bank, Groot! *

1155
01:32:14,798 --> 01:32:16,658
I told you there was
something wrong. *

1156
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:19,409
I also think so.
So, *

1157
01:32:19,766 --> 01:32:20,819
I *

1158
01:32:22,378 --> 01:32:23,581
*

1159
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:25,451
There are no objects
that can not talk.

1160
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:27,289
What are you doing?
You can kill us all.

1161
01:32:27,784 --> 01:32:29,445
Thank you, Rocket?

1162
01:32:29,853 --> 01:32:30,844
They are in control.

1163
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:33,252
Not.
This is just an extension of...

1164
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,598
...looks and real.

1165
01:32:35,111 --> 01:32:36,016
He'll be back shortly.

1166
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:37,115
What is Smurfette doing here?

1167
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,320
What I do is to go to
a place of safety.

1168
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:40,554
He's trying to kill me!

1169
01:32:40,844 --> 01:32:42,216
I saved you, stupid weasel!

1170
01:32:42,518 --> 01:32:43,665
He's not a fox.

1171
01:32:43,994 --> 01:32:45,508
I Groot.
- I'm not a raccoon as well.

1172
01:32:45,945 --> 01:32:47,027
I Groot.

1173
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:49,017
<i>Raccoon </i>.
Whatever.

1174
01:32:52,948 --> 01:32:54,008
How do we want to kill *

1175
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:55,505
There is one main core. *

1176
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:59,380
His mind, his soul, whatever,
have a framework of protection.

1177
01:32:59,727 --> 01:33:00,579
It's in the cave...

1178
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:01,874
...under the surface.

1179
01:33:04,725 --> 01:33:05,201
Yondu?

1180
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:15,913
Rocket engines are dead.

1181
01:33:16,164 --> 01:33:18,209
I think I should be
proud of my thin boy.

1182
01:33:18,465 --> 01:33:20,169
If not, you're sending
me to this madman.

1183
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:22,705
You remember?
That's why I saved you, you idiot.

1184
01:33:22,914 --> 01:33:24,785
That's what you
said to me, silly.

1185
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:26,999
Once I know what happened
to the other children...

1186
01:33:27,294 --> 01:33:28,530
...I will send you to him.

1187
01:33:29,053 --> 01:33:30,471
You said, you're
going to eat me.

1188
01:33:30,912 --> 01:33:32,162
It was just a mess.

1189
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,220
Not for me!

1190
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:35,704
You both did a lot of problems.

1191
01:33:35,972 --> 01:33:37,133
Of course, I have a problem.

1192
01:33:37,536 --> 01:33:39,959
That's my dad's scary!

1193
01:33:41,287 --> 01:33:42,258
*

1194
01:33:56,359 --> 01:33:58,367
We should go up!
- Can not.

1195
01:33:59,042 --> 01:34:01,401
The ego wants to rid the
universe as we know it.

1196
01:34:01,876 --> 01:34:02,654
We have to kill him.

1197
01:34:03,231 --> 01:34:03,789
Rocket!

1198
01:34:04,163 --> 01:34:04,667
Good!

1199
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:20,383
So, we save the universe again?

1200
01:34:20,778 --> 01:34:21,497
It tastes.

1201
01:34:21,896 --> 01:34:22,815
Great!

1202
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:27,366
We can not raise our
prices again...

1203
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:29,165
...if we are to be the
savior of the universe twice.

1204
01:34:29,551 --> 01:34:31,896
I really do not believe
that's what you think.

1205
01:34:32,135 --> 01:34:34,593
It was just a random thought.
I remember, we were friends.

1206
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:37,076
Of course, I worry about
the planet and building...

1207
01:34:37,382 --> 01:34:38,792
...and all the animals in the planet.

1208
01:34:39,138 --> 01:34:40,264
And all the people.

1209
01:34:40,969 --> 01:34:41,535
Meh.

1210
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:45,388
Grumpy puppy is very cute.
He made me almost want to die!

1211
01:35:23,783 --> 01:35:25,147
<i>Pilots...</i>

1212
01:35:25,447 --> 01:35:26,547
...drop the unit representative.

1213
01:35:29,112 --> 01:35:32,122
Our detectors detect the battery
under the planet's surface.

1214
01:35:35,006 --> 01:35:35,558
Jump!

1215
01:35:53,786 --> 01:35:54,408
Captain?

1216
01:35:55,117 --> 01:35:55,740
<i>Captain?</i>

1217
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:03,186
Tell me, why does the
ego wants you here?

1218
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:05,549
He needs to connect my
genetics at the light...

1219
01:36:05,786 --> 01:36:07,170
...to destroy the universe.

1220
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,056
He tried to teach me how
to control his powers.

1221
01:36:10,355 --> 01:36:11,010
So, can you?

1222
01:36:11,255 --> 01:36:12,111
A little bit.

1223
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,681
I make a ball.

1224
01:36:14,152 --> 01:36:14,833
A ball?

1225
01:36:15,474 --> 01:36:18,574
I've thought all my efforts.
That's all I can do.

1226
01:36:18,778 --> 01:36:19,495
You <i>think </i>?

1227
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,519
You think, when I created
this arrow fly...

1228
01:36:22,829 --> 01:36:24,057
...I use my head?

1229
01:36:36,049 --> 01:36:36,898
Wow.

1230
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:47,027
There.

1231
01:36:47,477 --> 01:36:48,464
That is the main thrust of the Ego.

1232
01:36:51,713 --> 01:36:53,148
Ore was thick, Rocket.

1233
01:36:53,614 --> 01:36:54,490
I solved it.

1234
01:37:01,532 --> 01:37:02,212
We need to fast.

1235
01:37:02,768 --> 01:37:04,752
It will not take long
to find our Ego.

1236
01:37:09,468 --> 01:37:10,123
Steady bit.

1237
01:37:17,136 --> 01:37:18,681
We dig into the
center, we kill him!

1238
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,499
<i>Captain?</i>

1239
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,838
What he, Kraglin?

1240
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,435
<i>Hey, remember the girl Ayesha?</i>

1241
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:31,544
Yes why?

1242
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,457
Why do not you use
the laser gun?

1243
01:37:56,906 --> 01:37:58,066
He blew up our generator.

1244
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,586
I think I made a small
explosive device.

1245
01:38:00,873 --> 01:38:02,769
Explosive device did not
work without a power source.

1246
01:38:03,235 --> 01:38:04,183
Well, we have this.

1247
01:38:05,695 --> 01:38:07,105
Is it enough to kill the ego?

1248
01:38:07,361 --> 01:38:09,845
If successful, it will
create a chain reaction...

1249
01:38:10,165 --> 01:38:11,469
...to the whole nervous system.

1250
01:38:11,715 --> 01:38:12,359
What does that mean?

1251
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:13,927
The whole planet is going to explode.

1252
01:38:14,228 --> 01:38:15,796
We need to get out
of here quickly.

1253
01:38:16,045 --> 01:38:17,431
I have made a timer.

1254
01:38:18,739 --> 01:38:19,013
Go!

1255
01:38:33,845 --> 01:38:34,952
He came.

1256
01:38:37,342 --> 01:38:38,515
Did not you say you
can make her fall?

1257
01:38:39,222 --> 01:38:41,097
While she wants.
He's too strong.

1258
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:42,536
I can not afford!

1259
01:38:43,694 --> 01:38:44,923
You do not have to
believe in yourself...

1260
01:38:45,826 --> 01:38:47,703
...because I believe in you.

1261
01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:01,349
Up!

1262
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,113
I do not think he can do it...

1263
01:39:10,575 --> 01:39:12,011
...with weak and
skinny like that.

1264
01:39:13,887 --> 01:39:15,781
I do not know how
long I can last.

1265
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,154
Iron is too thick...

1266
01:39:21,608 --> 01:39:22,587
...the bomb was memorable.

1267
01:39:22,845 --> 01:39:24,545
We need to put it on
the main terrace Ego.

1268
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:27,938
And we all can not *
into a small hole.

1269
01:39:28,533 --> 01:39:29,744
So...

1270
01:39:32,122 --> 01:39:33,383
It was a bad idea.

1271
01:39:33,896 --> 01:39:35,594
That's the only idea we have.

1272
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,250
Indeed disbelief.

1273
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,154
<i>Rockets do this.
Rockets do it.</i>

1274
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:43,772
That was my day.

1275
01:39:51,948 --> 01:39:55,080
Well, first you flick the
switch, and this switch.

1276
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,477
*

1277
01:39:57,001 --> 01:39:59,075
Then you press this button.

1278
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:01,225
It will give you 5 minutes
to get out of there.

1279
01:40:01,638 --> 01:40:03,693
Now, whatever you do...

1280
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:06,132
...do not press this button.

1281
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:09,818
For this bomb will explode
immediately and we will all die.

1282
01:40:10,278 --> 01:40:12,300
Now, repeat back what I said.

1283
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:14,240
I Groot.
- Yes.

1284
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,412
I Groot.
- That's right.

1285
01:40:16,871 --> 01:40:17,787
I Groot.
- Not!

1286
01:40:18,403 --> 01:40:20,409
No, it's a button that
will kill everyone!

1287
01:40:20,879 --> 01:40:21,995
One more time.

1288
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:26,686
I Groot.
- Yes.

1289
01:40:26,975 --> 01:40:27,972
I Groot.
- That's right.

1290
01:40:29,769 --> 01:40:30,358
I Groot.
- Not!

1291
01:40:30,767 --> 01:40:33,722
*

1292
01:40:34,068 --> 01:40:35,884
Button which you should press?

1293
01:40:36,204 --> 01:40:36,841
Show.

1294
01:40:37,671 --> 01:40:38,635
Not!

1295
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:40,344
<i>Hey, you make him afraid!</i>

1296
01:40:40,763 --> 01:40:42,431
Shut up!
Give me the tape!

1297
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:44,088
Those who have the tape?

1298
01:40:44,631 --> 01:40:45,982
I would like to
attach to the death.

1299
01:40:46,275 --> 01:40:48,235
I have no tape.
Let me check.

1300
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,456
<i>Hey, Yondu...</i>

1301
01:40:52,176 --> 01:40:53,440
<i>You have the tape?</i>

1302
01:40:56,947 --> 01:40:58,824
<i>Gamora?
You have the tape?</i>

1303
01:41:00,048 --> 01:41:00,578
<i>Tape!</i>

1304
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:01,906
<i>Nevermind.</i>

1305
01:41:04,602 --> 01:41:06,361
<i>Drax?
You have the tape?</i>

1306
01:41:07,865 --> 01:41:09,210
<i>Yes, Scotch tape shall be well.</i>

1307
01:41:10,088 --> 01:41:12,170
*

1308
01:41:14,807 --> 01:41:15,795
<i>Nobody band!</i>

1309
01:41:16,012 --> 01:41:17,750
A tape did not exist?

1310
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,093
Yes.

1311
01:41:19,369 --> 01:41:20,195
You ask the Nebula?

1312
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,660
Yes!

1313
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:22,957
Are you sure?

1314
01:41:23,271 --> 01:41:24,409
I asked Yondu...

1315
01:41:24,675 --> 01:41:25,717
...and he sat down next to him.

1316
01:41:25,964 --> 01:41:26,939
I know you're lying!

1317
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:28,986
There are priceless battery and
the atomic bomb in your bag.

1318
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:31,122
If those who have the
tape, it is you!

1319
01:41:31,645 --> 01:41:35,658
That's my point!
I have to do everything!

1320
01:41:35,885 --> 01:41:37,359
You are wasting time here!

1321
01:41:44,505 --> 01:41:45,383
We will all die.

1322
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:49,895
Rocket engines off again!

1323
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,330
We are finished
without a generator!

1324
01:42:06,693 --> 01:42:07,400
<i>Guardian...</i>

1325
01:42:08,553 --> 01:42:10,517
<i>Maybe he can give
you peace of...</i>

1326
01:42:10,735 --> 01:42:12,575
<i>...that your death
was not in vain.</i>

1327
01:42:13,064 --> 01:42:15,064
<i>It will serve as a warning...</i>

1328
01:42:15,276 --> 01:42:17,145
...to those who
want to betray us.

1329
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:20,316
Do not fooling Sovereign.

1330
01:42:24,902 --> 01:42:25,820
It would be a pain.

1331
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:26,928
Promise is promise.

1332
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:50,975
Not!

1333
01:42:52,058 --> 01:42:55,057
Not!

1334
01:42:59,635 --> 01:43:00,453
We are going to explode!

1335
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:07,959
Peter!
Not!

1336
01:43:27,914 --> 01:43:28,608
What?

1337
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:30,556
You look like Mary Poppins.

1338
01:43:31,308 --> 01:43:32,090
He chic?

1339
01:43:34,623 --> 01:43:35,501
Yes, he is stylish.

1340
01:43:36,949 --> 01:43:38,438
All I'm asking for Mary Poppins!

1341
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:07,486
Hey!

1342
01:44:20,328 --> 01:44:21,133
He just fainted.

1343
01:44:38,088 --> 01:44:39,121
How long before the
bombs explode?

1344
01:44:39,444 --> 01:44:41,688
If a situation where Groot
did not kill us all...

1345
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,149
...about 6 minutes.

1346
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:49,631
Kraglin, we need to
postpone the quadrant.

1347
01:44:49,967 --> 01:44:50,949
<i>Time to leave in 5 minutes.</i>

1348
01:44:51,135 --> 01:44:51,773
Well, captain.

1349
01:44:56,349 --> 01:44:58,108
A person should be above the
current Kraglin arrived.

1350
01:44:59,563 --> 01:45:00,592
Drax, bring Mantis.

1351
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:04,644
My Nipples!

1352
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,383
Gamora!

1353
01:45:18,614 --> 01:45:19,352
Peter!

1354
01:45:45,709 --> 01:45:46,639
Forget it.

1355
01:45:47,515 --> 01:45:50,465
Come on, Peter.
I know this is not what you want.

1356
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:57,195
I'm not the kind of dad let
you make a choice like that.

1357
01:46:27,602 --> 01:46:28,246
Yes!

1358
01:46:29,599 --> 01:46:32,829
Soon, Peter, but
we just got here.

1359
01:46:33,641 --> 01:46:36,690
So, do not make me angry!

1360
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:58,602
*

1361
01:47:06,734 --> 01:47:07,360
Go!

1362
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:08,416
I already told you...

1363
01:49:08,711 --> 01:49:11,623
...I do not want
to do it alone.

1364
01:49:16,019 --> 01:49:17,521
You can not deny...

1365
01:49:17,888 --> 01:49:20,811
...the purpose of the universe
that have been bestowed on you.

1366
01:49:30,486 --> 01:49:32,149
Listen, I want you all to go.

1367
01:49:32,534 --> 01:49:33,457
What is this?

1368
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,980
He did not have to happen like this, Peter.

1369
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:55,476
Why are you destroying
our chances?

1370
01:49:59,309 --> 01:50:01,606
Do not pretend to yourself.

1371
01:50:04,478 --> 01:50:05,569
One in a billion.

1372
01:50:06,807 --> 01:50:08,054
Trillion, even more.

1373
01:50:11,247 --> 01:50:15,158
What greater purpose
this life can give?

1374
01:50:18,306 --> 01:50:21,320
I did not use my head
for flying arrows!

1375
01:50:22,804 --> 01:50:25,128
I use my heart...

1376
01:50:59,863 --> 01:51:02,833
You should not have killed my
mother and my Walkman destroyed.

1377
01:51:44,019 --> 01:51:46,372
Groot, if you can
hear me, hurry!

1378
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:49,648
I do not know how much longer
Quill can distract him!

1379
01:51:50,067 --> 01:51:51,121
Groot, quickly!

1380
01:52:48,001 --> 01:52:49,704
Yondu, we are about to explode!

1381
01:52:50,279 --> 01:52:51,063
Go to the ship!

1382
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,711
I do not go without Quill!

1383
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,594
You need to take care of the timber!

1384
01:52:56,394 --> 01:52:57,371
I'm not going without you!

1385
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:02,061
My whole life, I've never
done the right thing.

1386
01:53:06,222 --> 01:53:07,176
You have to give it.

1387
01:53:18,473 --> 01:53:20,007
An aero spacesuits and tools.

1388
01:53:20,952 --> 01:53:22,424
I have each of them.

1389
01:53:35,736 --> 01:53:36,792
I Groot!

1390
01:53:38,354 --> 01:53:39,150
What's that?

1391
01:53:40,782 --> 01:53:44,507
He says, <i>Welcome to the
Guardians of the Galaxy.</i>

1392
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:47,778
Just do not call him rude verse.

1393
01:53:54,317 --> 01:53:55,180
Goodbye, wood.

1394
01:53:57,144 --> 01:53:59,499
We need to talk more
about your language.

1395
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:56,038
Where is Peter?

1396
01:54:57,247 --> 01:54:58,021
Rocket, where is he?

1397
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,519
Rocket?

1398
01:55:01,045 --> 01:55:02,262
Look at me!
Where is she?

1399
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:10,998
No, I will not
leave without her.

1400
01:55:18,163 --> 01:55:19,001
Sorry.

1401
01:55:19,849 --> 01:55:22,144
I can only just lost
a friend today.

1402
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:24,459
Kraglin, go!

1403
01:55:25,396 --> 01:55:26,105
Wait.

1404
01:55:26,884 --> 01:55:27,908
Quill will return?

1405
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:31,884
Rocket, where Quill?

1406
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:35,838
Rocket, where Quill?

1407
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,267
Rocket!

1408
01:55:40,355 --> 01:55:41,488
Where Quill?

1409
01:55:43,422 --> 01:55:44,781
Where Quill?

1410
01:55:53,841 --> 01:55:56,271
Do we have to stop it.

1411
01:56:01,019 --> 01:56:02,074
Stop.

1412
01:56:02,773 --> 01:56:04,231
Listen!

1413
01:56:04,856 --> 01:56:06,113
You are a god.

1414
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:09,334
If you kill me...

1415
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,565
...you will be like a normal person.

1416
01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:14,040
So, what's the problem?

1417
01:56:14,548 --> 01:56:15,455
Do not!

1418
01:57:06,733 --> 01:57:09,842
He may be your father,
but he's not your dad.

1419
01:57:14,468 --> 01:57:16,378
Sorry, I have not
done the right thing.

1420
01:57:17,504 --> 01:57:20,099
I am very fortunate to be
able to call you my son.

1421
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:24,777
What?

1422
01:57:37,013 --> 01:57:37,982
Yondu, what did you do this?

1423
01:57:38,493 --> 01:57:39,444
Do not.

1424
01:57:40,058 --> 01:57:41,538
Yondu!

1425
01:57:47,645 --> 01:57:48,408
Do not!

1426
01:57:53,697 --> 01:57:54,256
Do not!

1427
01:57:57,802 --> 01:57:59,978
Do not!

1428
01:58:01,869 --> 01:58:02,704
Do not!

1429
01:58:57,694 --> 01:58:59,045
I told Gamora...

1430
01:58:59,295 --> 01:59:02,955
...when I was little, I consider
as my father David Hasselhoff.

1431
01:59:05,641 --> 01:59:08,456
He is a singer and actor from *
famous.

1432
01:59:10,358 --> 01:59:11,582
Earlier, I noticed...

1433
01:59:13,307 --> 01:59:17,187
Yondu no cars to speak but
he has a flying arrow.

1434
01:59:18,236 --> 01:59:20,234
She was not a beautiful
voice like an angel...

1435
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:22,537
...but he's got a whistle.

1436
01:59:22,986 --> 01:59:26,287
Yondu and David Hasselhoff have
an interesting adventure...

1437
01:59:26,642 --> 01:59:28,958
and get acquainted with a beautiful woman...

1438
01:59:29,318 --> 01:59:30,796
...and fighting robots.

1439
01:59:33,929 --> 01:59:37,736
I think, in the end David
Hasselhoff it has become my father.

1440
01:59:38,393 --> 01:59:39,822
Only you alone, Yondu.

1441
01:59:45,913 --> 01:59:47,682
I do have a great dad.

1442
01:59:50,632 --> 01:59:52,367
What I want to say here is...

1443
01:59:54,273 --> 01:59:58,746
sometimes the things you want to
look for the rest of your life...

1444
02:00:01,202 --> 02:00:03,326
...are with you during this time.

1445
02:00:04,027 --> 02:00:05,870
You just do not realize.

1446
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:18,937
I Groot.

1447
02:00:20,602 --> 02:00:22,190
He was there to call you wood.

1448
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:25,871
Nebula.

1449
02:00:31,204 --> 02:00:32,475
I'm also a boy like you.

1450
02:00:34,108 --> 02:00:37,560
Every day, I worried about
how to survive the next day.

1451
02:00:38,117 --> 02:00:40,066
And I never cared what
Thanos had made with you.

1452
02:00:41,274 --> 02:00:42,458
I tried to correct the situation.

1453
02:00:43,249 --> 02:00:44,355
There is a little boy just like you...

1454
02:00:44,717 --> 02:00:46,919
...in the entire
universe is in danger.

1455
02:00:49,913 --> 02:00:51,327
You can be with
us and help them.

1456
02:00:52,525 --> 02:00:54,695
I will help them if they
want to kill Thanos.

1457
02:00:55,146 --> 02:00:56,718
I did not know it
could be achieved.

1458
02:01:11,991 --> 02:01:13,299
You will always be my brother.

1459
02:01:58,262 --> 02:01:59,123
Pete!

1460
02:02:03,307 --> 02:02:04,970
The captain found
something in store waste.

1461
02:02:05,272 --> 02:02:06,956
Said, you will return
to our society someday.

1462
02:02:09,618 --> 02:02:10,394
What is this?

1463
02:02:10,834 --> 02:02:11,965
It's called Zune.

1464
02:02:12,191 --> 02:02:13,843
Everyone heard this thing
on Earth right now.

1465
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,641
It contained 300 songs in it.

1466
02:02:16,001 --> 02:02:16,841
300 songs?

1467
02:02:22,973 --> 02:02:23,677
Wait.

1468
02:02:30,446 --> 02:02:32,323
Rocket take all the
pieces and re-fix.

1469
02:02:32,584 --> 02:02:34,163
I think Yondu want
you to have it.

1470
02:02:38,048 --> 02:02:38,923
Thank you.

1471
02:02:41,312 --> 02:02:42,268
Capt.

1472
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:08,585
<i>Father and Son Cat Stevens</i>

1473
02:03:54,293 --> 02:03:55,284
They're coming.

1474
02:04:03,395 --> 02:04:04,665
What?

1475
02:04:06,271 --> 02:04:09,830
I told the guys in Ravager
Yondu what he did.

1476
02:04:13,711 --> 02:04:15,059
{\an7}It was a funeral
entourage Ravager.

1477
02:04:32,527 --> 02:04:33,969
{\an7}Yes!

1478
02:04:34,516 --> 02:04:35,745
{\an7}Yes!

1479
02:04:43,687 --> 02:04:45,400
{\an7}He did not disappoint
us this time, captain.

1480
02:04:46,088 --> 02:04:47,411
{\an7}She never disappoint.

1481
02:04:08,587 --> 02:04:09,670
Never.

1482
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:19,762
Goodbye, old friend.

1483
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:26,940
Yondu Udonta, I will see
you again at the stars.

1484
02:04:31,316 --> 02:04:32,462
*

1485
02:04:33,419 --> 02:04:34,115
Not.

1486
02:04:35,492 --> 02:04:36,828
*

1487
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:39,181
*

1488
02:04:41,771 --> 02:04:43,275
*

1489
02:04:49,498 --> 02:04:50,677
Must be.

1490
02:05:15,172 --> 02:05:16,013
What?

1491
02:05:16,962 --> 02:05:18,354
Just...

1492
02:05:20,784 --> 02:05:22,510
There is something unspeakable.

1493
02:05:32,453 --> 02:05:34,063
It's beautiful.

1494
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,294
Really.

1495
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:39,947
Just like you.

1496
02:05:43,054 --> 02:05:43,932
Just inside.

1497
02:06:17,269 --> 02:06:19,989
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy will return</i>

1498
02:07:39,851 --> 02:07:41,319
You know, it's a shame...

1499
02:07:41,643 --> 02:07:45,270
...need a tragedy to lose Yondu
to bring us all together again.

1500
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:49,408
But I think he'd be proud
if we come back as a team.

1501
02:07:50,133 --> 02:07:50,683
I agree.

1502
02:07:50,989 --> 02:07:51,703
Me too.

1503
02:07:52,028 --> 02:07:53,750
I really miss you all!

1504
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,491
Really.

1505
02:07:58,748 --> 02:08:00,112
Why do not we go
steal something?

1506
02:10:19,703 --> 02:10:21,889
Top clergy, the
council is waiting.

1507
02:10:22,964 --> 02:10:25,615
They are very worried me
wasting their resources.

1508
02:10:30,577 --> 02:10:32,269
*

1509
02:10:33,486 --> 02:10:35,517
...their anger will disappear.

1510
02:10:37,174 --> 02:10:39,169
*

1511
02:10:40,779 --> 02:10:42,052
It was my son.

1512
02:10:42,811 --> 02:10:44,517
*

1513
02:10:44,996 --> 02:10:47,112
More powerful, more beautiful...

1514
02:10:47,881 --> 02:10:51,781
...more capable, to destroy
the Galactic Guardians.

1515
02:10:54,913 --> 02:10:57,293
I think I should call her.

1516
02:10:59,097 --> 02:11:00,018
Adam.
