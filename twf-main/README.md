# Description:

Our idea is a web-based solution i.e a website developed to solve various problems in this fight against COVID-19. It works on a volunteer system ( Volunteers include several people like Medical suppliers, Oxygen suppliers, Hospital Administrators, Doctors, Medical interns, Food and essentials Donors, etc.) which actively provides various services such as Supply of Medicines and Medical equipment, Hospital beds admissions, Oxygen supply, Home treatment, Health suggestions, Food and Daily essentials distribution, Vaccination registration to rural and remote areas, Plasma donation, etc. (Services include both commercial and free providers). The volunteers (service providers) register on the website and create a descriptive profile about their services so that service seekers can approach them.

In the present situation, the availability of various services and resources is not readily accessible to the people/patients who need them. So this system creates a centralized environment where direct contact establishes between the service providers and seekers such that everyone can get what they need to fight against COVID-19.

# Technology&#39;s Used:

For frontend design,

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) was used to design the application overall structure of the web site.
- To make it responsive and look better for User Interface CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was used along with html.
- The main goal is to make it responsive in both the Desktop devices as well as the Smart Phone devices.
- Bootstrap frame work was added to make responsive design can be used in both desktop and smart phones,
- Javascript plays a key role to add animation to this application

For Backend,

Client Side:

- JavaScript was used to handle client side data and display data to the users,

Server Side:

- To store the large amount of data and handle that data , we needed to use the Mysql Database.
- Mysql is an easy to use and can store very large amount of services data.
- Php Was used to perform the backend functionalities , to handle auth login , registration, retrieving data from data base, managing user data, working along with Mysql Data base.

The DataBase Design:

Mysql was used as Data Base to store data , the overall design of data base is simplified in the below diagram, to make consistency, data redundancy, this data base approach was used by decomposing various data base tables and interconnected using foreign keys.

Immediate need of Help:

Sometimes there can be situation&#39;s which requires immediate help for the issues, since many poor people are running out of basic need during the lockdown imposed by the government. Many poor families are suffering from hunger, running out of water not able to buy medicines. The team of TWF( Together We Fight ) applications provides an unique solution similar to social media. We have came up with an Get Help Service tab. This tab provides any user from any place can ask for help, using the service the user not even required to login or sign up, he/she can easily access directly and post their request to all the volunteers who are willing to help.

![alt text](https://github.com/shivajimeenugu/twf/blob/main/icons/s4.PNG?raw=true) This post request will let the user request to all the volunteers and help providers getting notified by an instant telegram notification message with all the details of the needy family, so instantly the volunteers can contact the suffering family and can provide the helping hand. This is a crucial service which let any remote user to come forward and ask for the help.

By clicking on the Create Post button user can provide the in the dialogue box
